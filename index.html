<h2> NEXT IS ABOUT POEM </h2>
<P1>Poetry is a form of <mark> art </mark>that uses aesthetic and often<strong> rhythmic qualities </strong>  language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, literal or surface-level meanings. Any particular instance of poetry is called a poem and is written by a poet. Poets use a variety of techniques called poetic devices, such as assonance, alliteration, euphony and cacophony, onomatopoeia, rhythm (via metre), and sound symbolism, to produce musical or other artistic effects</P1>
